# 3D-Ping-Pong-Game
3 D Ping Pong Game in Three.js using Computer Graphics concepts.

Libraries used:
- Dat.gui.js
- Three.js

# Getting started
Textures are used for various materials in this game. These textures are provided in 'Textures' folder. Running the Game.html file from your local system directly, will cause error in loading textures because browsers enforce strict security permissions to prevent you from reading files out of the local file system. 
To run the game successfully, you must run a local web server rather than using file://…. Node’s http-server is recommended. 

To install Node’s http-server: 
`npm install -g http-server`

Move to this project's directory and run Node’s http-server: 
`http-server &`

This will start the server on `http://localhost:8080` from the current working directory.
  
Run the game using the url: 
`http://localhost:8080/Game.html`
